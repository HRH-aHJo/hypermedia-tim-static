			<small><font size="3"><small><span style="font-family: Arial;">We develop new generation infrastructures with the goal of ensuring that around 84% of Italian houses have coverage via the new fixed ultra-broadband network and 98% of the population via&nbsp; the new mobile network by the end of 2018. As we believe digital technologies are the basis for a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. By the end of March 2016, with a total of 11 million km of installed fiber, the fixed network has already reached 45% of the houses and 1,100 municipalities; the mobile network reached 92% of the population and 6,200 municipalities.<br />

			To simplify the daily life there are new solutions: electronic payment systems, smart homes, electronic medical records and certified electronic mail in the healthcare and government sectors, for the schools&nbsp; interactive multimedia whiteboards and web-based learning environments. For businesses, advanced platforms for cloud computing for the virtualization of applications and infrastructures, a vast selection of applications for storing and managing data or controlling energy consumption, products and software to enhance the use of digital signatures.<br />
			<br />
			For everyone, digital technology means to be always connected and access services and digital&nbsp; content - games, e-books, music and films, all constantly enriched with premium contents - with ease and safety; all of this seamlessly on smartphones, tablets or other devices. &nbsp;<br />
			<br />
			Through the TIM Foundation we promote a vision of innovation and technology as social enablers, supporting projects in the fields of&nbsp; digital education and cultural innovation. As a result of the company&rsquo;s social and environmental commitment, we have been included among the most important and selective stock market Sustainability indexes worldwide, for the last eleven years.</span></small></font></small></h3>
